In this study, a full-scale bridge column with grouted sleeve (GS) connections and large-diameter (40 mm) reinforcing bars was investigated experimentally and numerically with comparison to a reference cast-in-place (CIP) column. Finite element models were established at the OpenSeesPy platform and validated against experimental results. Consequently, empirical equations are developed to predict effective rotational stiffness, post-yield stiffness ratio, ultimate moment, and ultimate rotation of joint sections. And the predicted parameters by empirical equations are compared with the calibrated parameters from the numerical analysis results. Finally, a simplified bilinear rotational spring was proposed to simulate strain penetration in GS and CIP columns. The availability of the simplified simulation method of strain penetration effects was confirmed with the numerical simulation results of full-scale tests. Results indicate that the failure mode, crack pattern, deformation, and resistance mechanism of the GS column are different from that of the CIP column. The first yield and maximum lateral load of the GS column are 6%, 5% larger than the CIP column, and the ultimate lateral displacement of the GS column is 96% of the CIP column. The numerical models generally matched well with the loadâ€“displacement curves and joint opening of tested columns. The simplified bilinear rotational spring with predicted parameters is effective in simulating strain penetration in GS and CIP columns.
