Drilled shafts with a larger diameter than columns are frequently adopted as the foundation of highway bridge columns due to their superior economic efficiency and lower impact on existing facilities in the urban built‐up area. Different section dimensions lead to a socket connection between the column and the oversized shaft and a noncontact lap splice of their longitudinal bars. The force‐transfer mechanism and failure process of column‐to‐drilled shaft connections were deeply revealed in this study. Detailed FE models were developed at the Diana platform and validated against previous experimental results. Subsequently, a parametric study investigated the effect of the shear span‐to‐depth ratio, diameter ratio of shaft‐to‐column, column embedment depth, and shaft stirrup ratio. Finally, a modified strut‐and‐tie model (STM) was proposed to design stirrups of the transition region efficiently considering the experimental failure mechanism. Results indicate that the numerical models built in the Diana platform can precisely simulate the mechanical behavior of column‐to‐drilled shaft connections. The failure mechanism of column‐to‐drilled shaft connections is shaft stirrups yield at the compressive side induced by extrusion between the embedded column and shaft. The lateral loading capacity of column‐to‐drilled shaft connections increases with the increase of shear span‐to‐depth ratio, diameter ratio of shaft‐to‐column, column embedment depth, and shaft stirrup ratio. The modified STM is able to reveal the variation tendency of shaft transverse reinforcement demand with the various design parameters and give an average stirrup stress ratio of 1.20 and a coefficient of variation of only 8.31%.
