The cloud method is one of the main tools for calculating the analytical fragility curves. How- ever, the assumptions of this method, viz., linearity, normality and homoscedasticity, which are aimed at sim- plifying the calculation process, are usually not consistent with the actual results. To solve this problem, a new fragility analysis method is proposed by combining BOX-COX regression and Monte Carlo Sampling technique. This method does not increase the times of the nonlinear time history analysis, and also need not restrict to the three basic assumptions of the cloud method. A three-span concrete continuous girder bridge is taken as an example to verify the validity of the method developed. Subsequently, the results obtained from the proposed method are compared with those of cloud method employing the determination coefficient, Kernel Density Estimation curve, and the rank-correlation coefficient. The result indicates that BOX-COX regression can improve the linearity, normality and homoskedasticity of the probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM), ensuring the accuracy of fragility analysis. The fragility curves derived applying cloud meth- od will lead to errors when the basic assumptions are not satisfied, and the errors increase with the damage state increasing.
